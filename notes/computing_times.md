# Computing times

## CoLoRe boxes
Lognormal:
- 89 s
- 32 nodes
- 110.76 CPU hours

2LPT
- 447 s
- 32 nodes
- 556.27 CPU hours

## corrf measurements (for a single box)
0.8-2.1.
The problem here are waiting jobs. Some of pixel measurements take less than 1 second, but most of them take 17 seconds.
- 31.73 CPU hours counting 17 seconds per pixel.

0.8-0.9
Curiously, it seems that for this bin range, all the measurements last less than 1 second.
- about 2 CPU hours.
